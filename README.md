## Statistics

If you check the option `Import historical statistics for selected contracts` then the statistics for the last 3 years
will be imported automatically into the `Energy dashboard` and will be kept up to date.

> The API returns data up to 24 or 48 hours before the actual date, and only once a day. It's unfortunately impossible
> to get a more granular statistics
